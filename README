NAME

    Git::Repository::Plugin::Test - Helper methods for testing interactions
    with Git

VERSION

    version 0.002

SYNOPSIS

        use Test::More tests => 2;
        use Git::Repository qw(Test);
    
        # easily create a temporary repository to test with
        my $repo = Git::Repository->new_tmp_repo();
    
        # run Git commands as tests
        $repo->run_exit_ok('status');
        $repo->run_exit_is(1, 'nonexistant-subcommand');
    
        # install a hook into the temporary repository
        $repo->install_hook('my-hook-file', 'pre-receive');

DESCRIPTION

    Adds run_exit_ok and run_exit_is methods to the Git::Repository object
    that can be used for testing Git operations.

METHODS

    Git::Repository::Plugin::Test adds the following methods:

 run_exit_ok(@cmd)

    Like Git::Repository's run but exceptions are caught and reported as
    test failures.

 run_exit_is($expected_exit_code, @cmd)

    Like Git::Repository's run but exceptions are caught and reported as
    test failures unless exit code matches expected exit code.

 init_tmp_repo(@init_opts)

    Initializes a new repository in a temporary directory. Options, such as
    --bare, can be passed in.

 new_tmp_repo(@init_opts, $options)

    Initializes a new repository in a temporary directory and returns a
    Git::Repository object. Like init_tmp_repo, new_tmp_repo accepts a list
    of options for the init command and like Git::Repository's new
    new_tmp_repo also accepts a reference to an option hash.

 install_hook($source, $target)

    Install a $target, e.g. 'pre-receive', hook into the repository.
